## Important Notes

### Security
- âœ… Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
- âœ… Always use Railway's environment variables for secrets
- âœ… The scanner will run in demo mode if credentials are missing

### Railway Limits (Free Tier)
- 500 hours/month execution time
- 100GB bandwidth
- Sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Consider upgrading for production use

### Monitoring
- View logs: Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ View Logs
- Set up alerts: Configure Telegram notifications
- Database: SQLite data persists across deployments

### Troubleshooting

**App not starting?**
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure all required files are committed

**WebSocket connection issues?**
- Railway supports WebSockets by default
- Check if Dhan credentials are correct
- Verify network connectivity

**Database errors?**
- SQLite file is created automatically
- Data persists in Railway's volume

## Step 5: Production Recommendations

1. **Upgrade Railway Plan** for:
   - No sleep/always-on
   - More resources
   - Custom domains

2. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Set up Telegram alerts
   - Configure health checks
   - Add error tracking (Sentry)

3. **Scale Configuration**:
   - Start with `batch_size: 50` in config.json
   - Gradually increase based on performance
   - Monitor memory usage in Railway metrics
